                <ul>
                    <li>Moved several XML manuals from the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) DTD schema to a the Flightbook schema, which is more industry accepted</li>
                    <li>Required line by line copy and paste from old XML schema to new XML schema</li>
                    <li>Approximately 3,000 pages of content moved</li>
                    <li>Rigorous quality reviews</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="dtd2">CMS Content Migration - Adobe FrameMaker to Arbortext</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Moved several manuals from Adobe FrameMaker into Arbortext.</li>
                    <li>Required line by line copy and paste from PDF to XML</li>
                    <li>Approximately 2,000 pages of content moved</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h3 id="dtd3">CMS Software Upgrades</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upgraded TechSuite multiple times over the years. </li>
                    <li>Each upgrade required detailed quality checks of all functions, in Dev, QA, and Production environments. </li>
                    <li>Worked with vendors, various technology groups, and coordinated with technical writers to ensure minimal work disruption.  </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h3 id="dtd4">Brand New CMS Software Install</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oracle content database were dated and no longer going to be supported. The new Oracle database demanded that TechSuite (Arbortext) also be updated at the same time.  </li>
                    <li>Initially, Technology implemented a plan tp just upgrade TechSuite and the database to keep costs low. But FlatIrons (TechSuite Vendor) did not have proper documentation and created multiple upgrade issues. </li>
                    <li>The upgrade ran over the alloted time and project budget for several months with little to no progress. We decided on a solution of a clean new database and TechSuite install. This required manually moving all content (100s of manuals and documents). </li>
                    <li>I led a team of 5 people to migrate the content from the old database to the new. We keet a copy of 100% of data, but only uploaded the last two revisions and any drafted content into the new content management system. </li>
                    <li>Worked with cross-function teams to stand new database, upgrade TechSuite, and coordinate content movement. </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="container">
                <h3 id="dtd5">Brand New Web Server</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Southwest Airlines Employee website (SWALife) moved from IBM WebSphere + Documentum to Microsoft SharePoint, which does not support HTML manuals. A new content web server was created for all manuals (both PDF and HTML), and all manuals are now located on this web server.</li>
                    <li>Worked with multiple groups to stand up new web server, set up security groups and SSO, work around revision schedules, find all links to our manuals in Documentum, and update links within manuals to point to new URL.  </li>
                    <li>Created forwarding/redirect pages for PDF and HTML. Could not just have redirect links since the entire Documentum webserver was shut down. </li>
                    <li>Created automation to update all links in all manuals to point to new URL. Each manual can be completed in under 1 minute, saving time and reducing risk. Refer to <a href="/mercedezsylvia.github.io/automate.html#webserver">Web Server Hyperlink Automation</a>. </li>
                    <li>Worked with Technology groups to set up a Tivoli script to push manuals to the Central Pubs Web Server during the next available synchronization time, which occurs daily at 7:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 5:00 PM, and 1:00 AM Central Standard Time. </li>
                    <li>Created new documentation for how to publish content on the new web server, maintaining the werbserver (e.g., restarts, scripts, contacts), naming conventions, and FAQ help. </li>
